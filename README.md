# Bank Customer Churn Prediction (ANN)

### Business Goal
Predict the likelihood of customer churn for a retail bank to support proactive retention and reduce revenue loss.

### Tools & Methods
Python · Pandas · NumPy · TensorFlow/Keras (ANN) · Scikit-learn · EDA · Model Evaluation

### Approach
- Performed EDA and data preprocessing (encoding, scaling, train/validation split)
- Built an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) for binary classification of churn
- Tuned architecture and regularization; evaluated with accuracy, precision/recall, and ROC-AUC

### Result
ANN model identified at-risk customer segments and enabled targeted retention recommendations.

### Next Steps / Improvement Ideas
- Add SHAP or permutation importance for interpretability
- Compare ANN to Gradient Boosting (XGBoost/LightGBM)
- Build a simple Streamlit dashboard for scenario testing
